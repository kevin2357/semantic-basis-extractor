## 2026-09-15 — Sprint creation

- Reviewed API Sprint 92 Slice 0 topology, Gate A response, and Slice 1 durable
  force-fence proposal.
- Confirmed cooperative native suspension is feasible only with a pre-launch
  invocation identity and bounded control channel.
- Closed the old `0.4.60` sprint around its actual relocated read-only
  assessment delivery and moved all prospective hard-stop work here.
- Froze the initial ownership rule: API owns fencing and process supervision;
  SBE owns truthful native safe-point and custody evidence; later resource
  release requires an explicit join.
- Added mandatory joint review before any runtime mutation or process-control
  work.

## 2026-09-15 — Slice 0 safe-point inventory

- Mapped direct authoring, ordinary-v2 dispatch, interactive reconciliation,
  initial-wave fan-out, optional qualitative stages, bounded, Batch, and
  terminal publication paths.
- Confirmed SBE has no current suspension request/control channel or signal
  handler. Existing invocation IDs are diagnostic or publication identities,
  not API pre-launch supervision authority.
- Identified exact interactive ordinary-v2 dispatch and response reconciliation
  as the cleanest first cooperative implementation cells.
- Recorded the unavoidable POST-entry-to-provider-ID ambiguity and the need for
  aggregate cancellation semantics before initial-wave fan-out can claim
  cooperative suspension.
- Paused at Voof-paws A before freezing Gate B fields or implementing runtime
  behavior.
